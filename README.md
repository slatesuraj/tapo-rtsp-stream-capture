# tapo-rtsp-stream-capture

The TP-Link Tapo camera device provides an rtsp feed for its video. Once a username and password is set in the app, it is available on: rtsp://user:pass@192.168.a.b:554/stream1
Use this link to setup username:password https://www.tapo.com/in/faq/34/

## Dependencies
Run below command to install project dependencies.
```sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

## Setup
Update rtsp url in record_rtsp.py file and run below command
```python record_rtsp.py```

By running this script, the RTSP stream will be recorded as an MP4 file named output.mp4 in the same directory. You can adjust the output file format and name as needed.

## Code explaination
1. Import OpenCV: Imports the necessary library.
2. Define record_rtsp function:
   a. Takes RTSP URL and output file path as input.
   b. Creates a VideoCapture object to capture the RTSP stream.
   c. Gets video properties (width, height, FPS).
   d. Defines the video codec and creates a VideoWriter object.
   e. Reads frames from the capture, writes them to the output file.
   f. Optionally, displays the frame (commented out).
   e. Releases resources.
3. Main block:
   a. Sets RTSP URL and output file path.
   b. Calls record_rtsp function to start recording.

## Future of this Project
I'll be adding capabilities like object detection, sound detction in the near future and later on i'll try to create model like thread detection, scene detection etc.
